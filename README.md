# Scheedule
Welcome to Scheedule, ACM@UIUC Webmonkeys' project beginning in Spring 2017

## How to get started
Run these commands in your terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uiucwebmonkeys/scheedule
cd scheedule
npm install     #install dependencies and put them in the node_modules folder

Open your browser to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the application

## Testing
To run karma tests, run:
```bash
npm test
```
For now, both tests fail due to lack of knowledge of karma/mocha.
