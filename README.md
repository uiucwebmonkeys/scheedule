Welcome to Scheedule, ACM@UIUC Webmonkeys' project beginning in Spring 2017

Prerequisite:
- npm must be installed on your computer (included with installation of Node.js)

Run these commands in your terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uiucwebmonkeys/scheedule
cd scheedule
npm install     #install dependencies and put them in the node_modules folder
npm start       #compile and run the program
```
Open your browser to http://localhost:8080/ to see the application

To run karma tests, run:
```bash
npm test
```
For now, both tests fail due to lack of knowledge of karma/mocha.

Want to get involved? Come to Webmonkeys on Tuesdays, 6-7pm.
